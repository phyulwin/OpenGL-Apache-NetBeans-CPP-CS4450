_Cal Poly Pomona, Spring 2025_

## About the Course  
This course introduced the core principles of **2D and 3D computer graphics**, covering everything from geometric transformations to OpenGL programming. We explored how graphical scenes are created, rendered, and animated â€” both theoretically and through hands-on coding.

Topics included:
- 2D and 3D drawing techniques
- Graphics pipeline and rendering hardware
- Geometric transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Clipping, windowing, and projection
- Color models (RGB, CMY, HSV)
- 3D modeling and basic animation
- Using OpenGL with C++ and NetBeans

## Tools Used
- **C++**
- **OpenGL (GLUT/GLEW)**
- **Apache NetBeans**
- **GLM (for matrix operations)**

## What I Learned
- How the graphics pipeline works from object space to screen space
- Hands-on experience using OpenGL to draw and manipulate 3D objects
- Writing shaders and handling vertex buffers
- Understanding transformations and projections deeply through code
- Basics of animation and user interaction in 3D scenes
